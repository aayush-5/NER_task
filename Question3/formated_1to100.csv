0,"<s> [INST] You are an automobile entity recognition agent, your task is to identify specific entities in the given paragraph. The paragraph contains information about a defect occured in some automobile. There are 4 labels in which each entity can be classified.
1. Failure Issue : Reason of failure or issues caused by failure.
2. Corrective Action : The action or precaution taken to correct the failure
3. Component : Any component of automobile that is mentioned in the paragraph
4. Vehicle Model : Model of the vehicle

Note: It is not necessary to include all the labels for a given paragraph. Each paragraph can have MULTIPLE ENTITIES for each label. The output should be IN JSON FORMAT ONLY.

EXAMPLE: 

Text Paragraph

CERTAIN PASSENGER VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH ZETEC ENGINES, LOOSE OR BROKEN ATTACHMENTS AND MISROUTED BATTERY CABLES COULD LEAD TO CABLE INSULATION DAMAGE. 
THIS, IN TURN, COULD CAUSE THE BATTERY CABLES TO SHORT RESULTING IN HEAT DAMAGE TO THE CABLES.  BESIDES HEAT DAMAGE, THE ""CHECK ENGINE"" LIGHT MAY ILLUMINATE, 
THE VEHICLE MAY FAIL TO START, OR SMOKE, MELTING, OR FIRE COULD ALSO OCCUR. DEALERS WILL INSPECT THE BATTERY CABLES FOR THE CONDITION OF THE CABLE INSULATION
AND PROPER TIGHTENING OF THE TERMINAL ENDS.  AS NECESSARY, CABLES WILL BE REROUTED, RETAINING CLIPS INSTALLED, AND DAMAGED BATTERY CABLES REPLACED.   
OWNER NOTIFICATION BEGAN FEBRUARY 10, 2003.   OWNERS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE THE FREE REMEDY  WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME SHOULD CONTACT FORD AT 1-866-436-7332.
ALSO CONTACT THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION'S AUTO SAFETY HOTLINE AT 1-888-DASH-2-DOT (1-888-327-4236).

Answer: 

{Entity: ""fracture of welds"", Label:""Failure Issue""}
Thought Process: Weld fractures occur when the material comprising a weld breaks apart or separates due to various factors such as stress, material defects, or improper welding techniques. Weld fractures can lead to equipment failure.

{Entity: ""ZETEC ENGINES"", Label:""Component""}
Thought Process: ZETEC ENGINES is a component of the vehicles produced by Ford Motor Company.

{Entity: ""CABLE INSULATION AND PROPER TIGHTENING"", Label:""Corrective Action""}
Thought Process : Cable insulation and proper tightening are interconnected aspects in electrical systems of cars. Improper tightening can lead to issues such as short circuits. This entity thus represents Corrective Action. 

{Entity: ""FORD"", Label:""Vehicle Brand""}
Thought Process: Here the brand or company name of the vehicle is FORD.

Text Paragraph

CERTAIN PASSENGER VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH ZETEC ENGINES, LOOSE OR BROKEN ATTACHMENTS AND MISROUTED BATTERY CABLES COULD LEAD TO CABLE INSULATION DAMAGE. 
THIS, IN TURN, COULD CAUSE THE BATTERY CABLES TO SHORT RESULTING IN HEAT DAMAGE TO THE CABLES.  BESIDES HEAT DAMAGE, THE ""CHECK ENGINE"" LIGHT MAY ILLUMINATE, 
THE VEHICLE MAY FAIL TO START, OR SMOKE, MELTING, OR FIRE COULD ALSO OCCUR. DEALERS WILL INSPECT THE BATTERY CABLES FOR THE CONDITION OF THE CABLE INSULATION
AND PROPER TIGHTENING OF THE TERMINAL ENDS.  AS NECESSARY, CABLES WILL BE REROUTED, RETAINING CLIPS INSTALLED, AND DAMAGED BATTERY CABLES REPLACED.

Answer: 

{Entity: ""fracture of welds"", Label:""Failure Issue""}
Thought Process: Weld fractures occur when the material comprising a weld breaks apart or separates due to various factors such as stress, material defects, or improper welding techniques. Weld fractures can lead to equipment failure.

{Entity: ""ZETEC ENGINES"", Label:""Component""}
Thought Process: ZETEC ENGINES is a component of the vehicles produced by Ford Motor Company.

{Entity: ""CABLE INSULATION AND PROPER TIGHTENING"", Label:""Corrective Action""}
Thought Process : Cable insulation and proper tightening are interconnected aspects in electrical systems of cars. Improper tightening can lead to issues such as short circuits. This entity thus represents Corrective Action.

Text Paragraph

CERTAIN PASSENGER VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH ZETEC ENGINES, LOOSE OR BROKEN ATTACHMENTS AND MISROUTED BATTERY CABLES COULD LEAD TO CABLE INSULATION DAMAGE. 
THIS, IN TURN, COULD CAUSE THE BATTERY CABLES TO SHORT RESULTING IN HEAT DAMAGE TO THE CABLES.  BESIDES HEAT DAMAGE, THE ""CHECK ENGINE"" LIGHT MAY ILLUMINATE, 
THE VEHICLE MAY FAIL TO START, OR SMOKE, MELTING, OR FIRE COULD ALSO OCCUR. DEALERS WILL INSPECT THE BATTERY CABLES FOR THE CONDITION OF THE CABLE INSULATION
AND PROPER TIGHTENING OF THE TERMINAL ENDS.  AS NECESSARY, CABLES WILL BE REROUTED, RETAINING CLIPS INSTALLED, AND DAMAGED BATTERY CABLES REPLACED.   
OWNER NOTIFICATION BEGAN FEBRUARY 10, 2003.   OWNERS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE THE FREE REMEDY  WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME SHOULD CONTACT FORD AT 1-866-436-7332.

Answer: 

{Entity: ""fracture of welds"", Label:""Failure Issue""}
Thought Process: Weld fractures occur when the material comprising a weld breaks apart or separates due to various factors such as stress, material defects, or improper welding techniques. Weld fractures can lead to equipment failure.

{Entity: ""ZETEC ENGINES"", Label:""Component""}
Thought Process: ZETEC ENGINES is a component of the vehicles produced by Ford Motor Company.

{Entity: ""CABLE INSULATION AND PROPER TIGHTENING"", Label:""Corrective Action""}
Thought Process : Cable insulation and proper tightening are interconnected aspects in electrical systems of cars. Improper tightening can lead to issues such as short circuits. This entity thus represents Corrective Action. 

{Entity: ""FORD"", Label:""Vehicle Brand""}

Answer: 

{Entity: ""fracture of welds"", Label:""Failure Issue""}
Thought Process: Weld fractures occur when the material comprising a weld breaks apart or separates due to various factors such as stress, material defects, or improper welding techniques. Weld fractures can lead to equipment failure.

{Entity: ""ZETEC ENGINES"", Label:""Component""}
Thought Process: ZETEC ENGINES is a component of the vehicles produced by Ford Motor Company.

{Entity: ""CABLE INSULATION AND PROPER TIGHTENING"", Label:""Corrective Action""}
Thought Process : Cable insulation and proper tightening are interconnected aspects in electrical systems of cars. Improper tightening can lead to issues such as short circuits. This entity thus represents Corrective Action. 

{Entity: ""FORD"", Label:""Vehicle Brand""}

Text Paragraph

CERTAIN PASSENGER VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH ZETEC ENGINES, LOOSE OR BROKEN ATTACHMENTS AND MISROUTED BATTERY CABLES COULD LEAD TO CABLE INSULATION DAMAGE. 
THIS, IN TURN, COULD CAUSE THE BATTERY CABLES TO SHORT RESULTING IN HEAT DAMAGE TO THE CABLES.  BESIDES HEAT DAMAGE, THE ""CHECK ENGINE"" LIGHT MAY ILLUMINATE, 
THE VEHICLE MAY FAIL TO START, OR SMOKE, MELTING, OR FIRE COULD ALSO OCCUR. DEALERS WILL INSPECT THE BATTERY CABLES FOR THE CONDITION OF THE CABLE INSULATION
AND PROPER TIGHTENING OF THE TERMINAL ENDS.  AS NECESSARY, CABLES WILL BE REROUTED, RETAINING CLIPS INSTALLED, AND DAMAGED BATTERY CABLES REPLACED.   
OWNER NOTIFICATION BEGAN FEBRUARY 10, 2003.   OWNERS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE THE FREE REMEDY  WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME SHOULD CONTACT FORD AT 1-866-436-7332.

Answer: 

{Entity: ""fracture of welds"", Label:""Failure Issue""}
Thought Process: Weld fractures occur when the material comprising a weld breaks apart or separates due to various factors such as stress, material defects, or improper welding techniques. Weld fractures can lead to equipment failure.

{Entity: ""ZETEC ENGINES"", Label:""Component""}
Thought Process: ZETEC ENGINES is a component of the vehicles produced by Ford Motor Company.

{Entity: ""CABLE INSULATION AND PROPER TIGHTENING"", Label:""Corrective Action""}
Thought Process : Cable insulation and proper tightening are interconnected aspects in electrical systems of cars. Improper tightening can lead to issues such as short circuits. This entity thus represents Corrective Action.

Text Paragraph

CERTAIN PASSENGER VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH ZETEC ENGINES, LOOSE OR BROKEN ATTACHMENTS AND MISROUTED BATTERY CABLES COULD LEAD TO CABLE INSULATION DAMAGE. 
THIS, IN TURN, COULD CAUSE THE BATTERY CABLES TO SHORT RESULTING IN HEAT DAMAGE TO THE CABLES.  BESIDES HEAT DAMAGE, THE ""CHECK ENGINE"" LIGHT MAY ILLUMINATE, 
THE VEHICLE MAY FAIL TO START, OR SMOKE, MELTING, OR FIRE COULD ALSO OCCUR. DEALERS WILL INSPECT THE BATTERY CABLES FOR THE CONDITION OF THE CABLE INSULATION
AND PROPER TIGHTENING OF THE TERMINAL ENDS.  AS NECESSARY, CABLES WILL BE REROUTED, RETAINING CLIPS INSTALLED, AND DAMAGED BATTERY CABLES REPLACED.   
OWNER NOTIFICATION BEGAN FEBRUARY 10, 2003.   OWNERS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE THE FREE REMEDY  WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME SHOULD CONTACT FORD AT 1-866-436-7332.

Answer: 

{Entity: ""fracture of welds"", Label:""Failure Issue""}
Thought Process: Weld fractures occur when the material comprising a weld breaks apart or separates due to various factors such as stress, material defects, or improper welding techniques. Weld fractures can lead to equipment failure.

{Entity: ""ZETEC ENGINES"", Label:""Component""}
Thought Process: ZETEC ENGINES is a component of the vehicles produced by Ford Motor Company.

{Entity: ""CABLE INSULATION AND PROPER TIGHTENING"", Label:""Corrective Action""}
Thought Process : Cable insulation and proper tightening are interconnected aspects in electrical systems of cars. Improper tightening can lead to issues such as short circuits. This entity thus represents Corrective Action. 

{Entity: ""FORD"", Label:""Vehicle Brand""}

Text Paragraph

CERTAIN PASSENGER VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH ZETEC ENGINES, LOOSE OR BROKEN ATTACHMENTS AND MISROUTED BATTERY CABLES COULD LEAD TO CABLE INSULATION DAMAGE. 
THIS, IN TURN, COULD CAUSE THE BATTERY CABLES TO SHORT RESULTING IN HEAT DAMAGE TO THE CABLES.  BESIDES HEAT DAMAGE, THE ""CHECK ENGINE"" LIGHT MAY ILLUMINATE, 
THE VEHICLE MAY FAIL TO START, OR SMOKE, MELTING, OR FIRE COULD ALSO OCCUR. DEALERS WILL INSPECT THE BATTERY CABLES FOR THE CONDITION OF THE CABLE INSULATION
AND PROPER TIGHTENING OF THE TERMINAL ENDS.  AS NECESSARY, CABLES WILL BE REROUTED, RETAINING CLIPS INSTALLED, AND DAMAGED BATTERY CABLES REPLACED.   
OWNER NOTIFICATION BEGAN FEBRUARY 10, 2003.   OWNERS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE THE FREE REMEDY  WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME SHOULD CONTACT FORD AT 1-866-436-7332.

Answer: 

{Entity: ""fracture of welds"", Label:""Failure Issue""}
Thought Process: Weld fractures occur when the material comprising a weld breaks apart or separates due to various factors such as stress, material defects, or improper welding techniques. Weld fractures can lead to equipment failure.

{Entity: ""ZETEC ENGINES"", Label:""Component""}
Thought Process: ZETEC ENGINES is a component of the vehicles produced by Ford Motor Company.

{Entity: ""CABLE INSULATION AND PROPER TIGHTENING"", Label:""Corrective Action""}
Thought Process : Cable insulation and proper tightening are interconnected aspects in electrical systems of cars. Improper tightening can lead to issues such as short circuits. This entity thus represents Corrective Action. 

{Entity: ""FORD"", Label:""Vehicle Brand""}
Thought Process: Here the brand or company name of the vehicle is FORD.

CERTAIN PASSENGER VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH ZETEC ENGINES, LOOSE OR BROKEN ATTACHMENTS AND MISROUTED BATTERY CABLES COULD LEAD TO CABLE INSULATION DAMAGE. 
THIS, IN TURN, COULD CAUSE THE BATTERY CABLES TO SHORT RESULTING IN HEAT DAMAGE TO THE CABLES.  BESIDES HEAT DAMAGE, THE ""CHECK ENGINE"" LIGHT MAY ILLUMINATE, 
THE VEHICLE MAY FAIL TO START, OR SMOKE, MELTING, OR FIRE COULD ALSO OCCUR. DEALERS WILL INSPECT THE BATTERY CABLES FOR THE CONDITION OF THE CABLE INSULATION

Answer: 

{Entity: ""fracture of welds"", Label:""Failure Issue""}
Thought Process: Weld fractures occur when the material comprising a weld breaks apart or separates due to various factors such as stress, material defects, or improper welding techniques. Weld fractures can lead to equipment failure.

{Entity: ""ZETEC ENGINES"", Label:""Component""}
Thought Process: ZETEC ENGINES is a component of the vehicles produced by Ford Motor Company.

{Entity: ""CABLE INSULATION AND PROPER TIGHTENING"", Label:""Corrective Action""}
Thought Process : Cable insulation and proper tightening are interconnected aspects in electrical systems of cars. Improper tightening can lead to issues such as short circuits. This entity thus represents Corrective Action. 

{Entity: ""FORD"", Label:""Vehicle Brand""}

Text Paragraph

CERTAIN PASSENGER VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH ZETEC ENGINES, LOOSE OR BROKEN ATTACHMENTS AND MISROUTED BATTERY CABLES COULD LEAD TO CABLE INSULATION DAMAGE. 
THIS, IN TURN, COULD CAUSE THE BATTERY CABLES TO SHORT RESULTING IN HEAT DAMAGE TO THE CABLES.  BESIDES HEAT DAMAGE, THE ""CHECK ENGINE"" LIGHT MAY ILLUMINATE, 
THE VEHICLE MAY FAIL TO START, OR SMOKE, MELTING, OR FIRE COULD ALSO OCCUR. DEALERS WILL INSPECT THE BATTERY CABLES FOR THE CONDITION OF THE CABLE INSULATION
AND PROPER TIGHTENING OF THE TERMINAL ENDS.  AS NECESSARY, CABLES WILL BE REROUTED, RETAINING CLIPS INSTALLED, AND DAMAGED BATTERY CABLES REPLACED.   
OWNER NOTIFICATION BEGAN FEBRUARY 10, 2003.   OWNERS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE THE FREE REMEDY  WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME SHOULD CONTACT FORD AT 1-866-436-7332.

Answer: 

{Entity: ""fracture of welds"", Label:""Failure Issue""}
Thought Process: Weld fractures occur when the material comprising a weld breaks apart or separates due to various factors such as stress, material defects, or improper welding techniques. Weld fractures can lead to equipment failure.

{Entity: ""ZETEC ENGINES"", Label:""Component""}
Thought Process: ZETEC ENGINES is a component of the vehicles produced by Ford Motor Company.

{Entity: ""CABLE INSULATION AND PROPER TIGHTENING"", Label:""Corrective Action""}
Thought Process : Cable insulation and proper tightening are interconnected aspects in electrical systems of cars. Improper tightening can lead to issues such as short circuits. This entity thus represents Corrective Action. 

{Entity: ""FORD"", Label:""Vehicle Brand""}

CERTAIN PASSENGER VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH ZETEC ENGINES, LOOSE OR BROKEN ATTACHMENTS AND MISROUTED BATTERY CABLES COULD LEAD TO CABLE INSULATION DAMAGE. 
THIS, IN TURN, COULD CAUSE THE BATTERY CABLES TO SHORT RESULTING IN HEAT DAMAGE TO THE CABLES.  BESIDES HEAT DAMAGE, THE ""CHECK ENGINE"" LIGHT MAY ILLUMINATE, 
THE VEHICLE MAY FAIL TO START, OR SMOKE, MELTING, OR FIRE COULD ALSO OCCUR. DEALERS WILL INSPECT THE BATTERY CABLES FOR THE CONDITION OF THE CABLE INSULATION
AND PROPER TIGHTENING OF THE TERMINAL ENDS.  AS NECESSARY, CABLES WILL BE REROUTED, RETAINING CLIPS INSTALLED, AND DAMAGED BATTERY CABLES REPLACED.

Text Paragraph

CERTAIN PASSENGER VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH ZETEC ENGINES, LOOSE OR BROKEN ATTACHMENTS AND MISROUTED BATTERY CABLES COULD LEAD TO CABLE INSULATION DAMAGE. 
THIS, IN TURN, COULD CAUSE THE BATTERY CABLES TO SHORT RESULTING IN HEAT DAMAGE TO THE CABLES.  BESIDES HEAT DAMAGE, THE ""CHECK ENGINE"" LIGHT MAY ILLUMINATE, 
THE VEHICLE MAY FAIL TO START, OR SMOKE, MELTING, OR FIRE COULD ALSO OCCUR. DEALERS WILL INSPECT THE BATTERY CABLES FOR THE CONDITION OF THE CABLE INSULATION
AND PROPER TIGHTENING OF THE TERMINAL ENDS.  AS NECESSARY, CABLES WILL BE REROUTED, RETAINING CLIPS INSTALLED, AND DAMAGED BATTERY CABLES REPLACED.   
OWNER NOTIFICATION BEGAN FEBRUARY 10, 2003.   OWNERS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE THE FREE REMEDY  WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME SHOULD CONTACT FORD AT 1-866-436-7332.

Answer: 

{Entity: ""fracture of welds"", Label:""Failure Issue""}
Thought Process: Weld fractures occur when the material comprising a weld breaks apart or separates due to various factors such as stress, material defects, or improper welding techniques. Weld fractures can lead to equipment failure.

{Entity: ""ZETEC ENGINES"", Label:""Component""}
Thought Process: ZETEC ENGINES is a component of the vehicles produced by Ford Motor Company.

{Entity: ""CABLE INSULATION AND PROPER TIGHTENING"", Label:""Corrective Action""}
Thought Process : Cable insulation and proper tightening are interconnected aspects in electrical systems of cars. Improper tightening can lead to issues such as short circuits. This entity thus represents Corrective Action.

Answer: 

{Entity: ""fracture of welds"", Label:""Failure Issue""}
Thought Process: Weld fractures occur when the material comprising a weld breaks apart or separates due to various factors such as stress, material defects, or improper welding techniques. Weld fractures can lead to equipment failure.

{Entity: ""ZETEC ENGINES"", Label:""Component""}
Thought Process: ZETEC ENGINES is a component of the vehicles produced by Ford Motor Company.

{Entity: ""CABLE INSULATION AND PROPER TIGHTENING"", Label:""Corrective Action""}
Thought Process : Cable insulation and proper tightening are interconnected aspects in electrical systems of cars. Improper tightening can lead to issues such as short circuits. This entity thus represents Corrective Action.

Answer: 

{Entity: ""fracture of welds"", Label:""Failure Issue""}
Thought Process: Weld fractures occur when the material comprising a weld breaks apart or separates due to various factors such as stress, material defects, or improper welding techniques. Weld fractures can lead to equipment failure.

{Entity: ""ZETEC ENGINES"", Label:""Component""}
Thought Process: ZETEC ENGINES is a component of the vehicles produced by Ford Motor Company.

{Entity: ""CABLE INSULATION AND PROPER TIGHTENING"", Label:""Corrective Action""}
Thought Process : Cable insulation and proper tightening are interconnected aspects in electrical systems of cars. Improper tightening can lead to issues such as short circuits. This entity thus represents Corrective Action.

Text Paragraph

CERTAIN PASSENGER VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH ZETEC ENGINES, LOOSE OR BROKEN ATTACHMENTS AND MISROUTED BATTERY CABLES COULD LEAD TO CABLE INSULATION DAMAGE. 
THIS, IN TURN, COULD CAUSE THE BATTERY CABLES TO SHORT RESULTING IN HEAT DAMAGE TO THE CABLES.  BESIDES HEAT DAMAGE, THE ""CHECK ENGINE"" LIGHT MAY ILLUMINATE, 
THE VEHICLE MAY FAIL TO START, OR SMOKE, MELTING, OR FIRE COULD ALSO OCCUR. DEALERS WILL INSPECT THE BATTERY CABLES FOR THE CONDITION OF THE CABLE INSULATION
AND PROPER TIGHTENING OF THE TERMINAL ENDS.  AS NECESSARY, CABLES WILL BE REROUTED, RETAINING CLIPS INSTALLED, AND DAMAGED BATTERY CABLES REPLACED.   
OWNER NOTIFICATION BEGAN FEBRUARY 10, 2003.   OWNERS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE THE FREE REMEDY  WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME SHOULD CONTACT FORD AT 1-866-436-7332.

Answer: 

{Entity: ""fracture of welds"", Label:""Failure Issue""}
Thought Process: Weld fractures occur when the material comprising a weld breaks apart or separates due to various factors such as stress, material defects, or improper welding techniques. Weld fractures can lead to equipment failure.

{Entity: ""ZETEC ENGINES"", Label:""Component""}
Thought Process: ZETEC ENGINES is a component of the vehicles produced by Ford Motor Company.

{Entity: ""CABLE INSULATION AND PROPER TIGHTENING"", Label:""Corrective Action""}
Thought Process : Cable insulation and proper tightening are interconnected aspects in electrical systems of cars. Improper tightening can lead to issues such as short circuits. This entity thus represents Corrective Action. 

{Entity: ""FORD"", Label:""Vehicle Brand""}

Text Paragraph

CERTAIN PASSENGER VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH ZETEC ENGINES, LOOSE OR BROKEN ATTACHMENTS AND MISROUTED BATTERY CABLES COULD LEAD TO CABLE INSULATION DAMAGE. 
THIS, IN TURN, COULD CAUSE THE BATTERY CABLES TO SHORT RESULTING IN HEAT DAMAGE TO THE CABLES.  BESIDES HEAT DAMAGE, THE ""CHECK ENGINE"" LIGHT MAY ILLUMINATE, 
THE VEHICLE MAY FAIL TO START, OR SMOKE, MELTING, OR FIRE COULD ALSO OCCUR. DEALERS WILL INSPECT THE BATTERY CABLES FOR THE CONDITION OF THE CABLE INSULATION
AND PROPER TIGHTENING OF THE TERMINAL ENDS.  AS NECESSARY, CABLES WILL BE REROUTED, RETAINING CLIPS INSTALLED, AND DAMAGED BATTERY CABLES REPLACED.   
OWNER NOTIFICATION BEGAN FEBRUARY 10, 2003.   OWNERS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE THE FREE REMEDY  WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME SHOULD CONTACT FORD AT 1-866-436-7332.

Answer: 

{Entity: ""fracture of welds"", Label:""Failure Issue""}
Thought Process: Weld fractures occur when the material comprising a weld breaks apart or separates due to various factors such as stress, material defects, or improper welding techniques. Weld fractures can lead to equipment failure.

{Entity: ""ZETEC ENGINES"", Label:""Component""}
Thought Process: ZETEC ENGINES is a component of the vehicles produced by Ford Motor Company.

{Entity: ""CABLE INSULATION AND PROPER TIGHTENING"", Label:""Corrective Action""}
Thought Process : Cable insulation and proper tightening are interconnected aspects in electrical systems of cars. Improper tightening can lead to issues such as short circuits. This entity thus represents Corrective Action. 

{Entity: ""FORD"", Label:""Vehicle Brand""}
Thought Process: Here the brand or company name of the vehicle is FORD.

Text Paragraph

CERTAIN PASSENGER VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH ZETEC ENGINES, LOOSE OR BROKEN ATTACHMENTS AND MISROUTED BATTERY CABLES COULD LEAD TO CABLE INSULATION DAMAGE. 
THIS, IN TURN, COULD CAUSE THE BATTERY CABLES TO SHORT RESULTING IN HEAT DAMAGE TO THE CABLES.  BESIDES HEAT DAMAGE, THE ""CHECK ENGINE"" LIGHT MAY ILLUMINATE, 
THE VEHICLE MAY FAIL TO START, OR SMOKE, MELTING, OR FIRE COULD ALSO OCCUR. DEALERS WILL INSPECT THE BATTERY CABLES FOR THE CONDITION OF THE CABLE INSULATION
AND PROPER TIGHTENING OF THE TERMINAL ENDS.  AS NECESSARY, CABLES WILL BE REROUTED, RETAINING CLIPS INSTALLED, AND DAMAGED BATTERY CABLES REPLACED.   
OWNER NOTIFICATION BEGAN FEBRUARY 10, 2003.   OWNERS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE THE FREE REMEDY  WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME SHOULD CONTACT FORD AT 1-866-436-7332.

Answer: 

{Entity: ""fracture of welds"", Label:""Failure Issue""}
Thought Process: Weld fractures occur when the material comprising a weld breaks apart or separates due to various factors such as stress, material defects, or improper welding techniques. Weld fractures can lead to equipment failure.

{Entity: ""ZETEC ENGINES"", Label:""Component""}
Thought Process: ZETEC ENGINES is a component of the vehicles produced by Ford Motor Company.

{Entity: ""CABLE INSULATION AND PROPER TIGHTENING"", Label:""Corrective Action""}
Thought Process : Cable insulation and proper tightening are interconnected aspects in electrical systems of cars. Improper tightening can lead to issues such as short circuits. This entity thus represents Corrective Action.

THE VEHICLE MAY FAIL TO START, OR SMOKE, MELTING, OR FIRE COULD ALSO OCCUR. DEALERS WILL INSPECT THE BATTERY CABLES FOR THE CONDITION OF THE CABLE INSULATION
AND PROPER TIGHTENING OF THE TERMINAL ENDS.  AS NECESSARY, CABLES WILL BE REROUTED, RETAINING CLIPS INSTALLED, AND DAMAGED BATTERY CABLES REPLACED.

Answer: 

{Entity: ""fracture of welds"", Label:""Failure Issue""}
Thought Process: Weld fractures occur when the material comprising a weld breaks apart or separates due to various factors such as stress, material defects, or improper welding techniques. Weld fractures can lead to equipment failure.

{Entity: ""ZETEC ENGINES"", Label:""Component""}
Thought Process: ZETEC ENGINES is a component of the vehicles produced by Ford Motor Company.

{Entity: ""CABLE INSULATION AND PROPER TIGHTENING"", Label:""Corrective Action""}
Thought Process : Cable insulation and proper tightening are interconnected aspects in electrical systems of cars. Improper tightening can lead to issues such as short circuits. This entity thus represents Corrective Action. 

{Entity: ""FORD"", Label:""Vehicle Brand""}
Thought Process: Here the brand or company name of the vehicle is FORD.

I will provide you a paragraph, do entity recognition based on the above instructions. 
Each paragraph can have MULTIPLE ENTITIES for each label.

Text Paragraph:

ON CERTAIN STREETCARS (DIESEL AND CNG MODELS) AND RT-52 DIESEL COACHES MANUFACTURED WITH AT-545 AND MT643 TRANSMISSIONS WHICH USE A MANUAL TRANSMISSION CONTROL CABLE.  THE TRANSMISSION CONTROL CABLE MAY RUB AGAINST THE JUNCTION BOX POWER STUD LOCATED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE JUNCTION BOX.LONG-TERM WEAR CAN ALLOW THE POWER STUD TO SHORT TO GROUND THROUGH THE TRANSMISSION CONTROL CABLE, RESULTING IN ELECTRICAL ARCING AND THE IGNITION OF COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS IN THE JUNCTION BOX COMPARTMENT.DEALERS WILL INSPECT THE VEHICLE TO DETERMINE IF EITHER THE POWER STUD INSULATION BOOT AND/OR THE TRANSMISSION SHIFT CABLE CLAMP IS MISSING.  BOTH THE INSULATION BOOT AND THE CLAMP WILL BE INSTALLED IF MISSING.     OWNER NOTIFICATION IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN DURING JULY 2002.    OWNERS WHO TAKE THEIR VEHICLES TO AN AUTHORIZED DEALER ON AN AGREED UPON SERVICE DATE AND DO NOT RECEIVE THE FREE REMEDY WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME SHOULD CONTACT CHANCE COACH AT 1-888-391-1777.ALSO, CUSTOMERS CAN CONTACT THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION'S AUTO SAFETY HOTLINE AT 1-888-DASH-2-DOT (1-888-327-4236).
